Xedni lets you do CRUD actions on the records:
Xedni does not supply GUIDs - you must do so. or some unique key (like table_name_#{id})

Query
Create  (or update works as well).
Read
Update
Delete

You can get all the information about a record through 'Read'.
You can update the records facets (or it's score) with update / create
You can remove a record from the system with Delete. (that's a hard remove... no going back!)

==Query allows you to make a query on the database.
