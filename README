Xedni lets you do CRUD actions on the records:
Xedni does not supply GUIDs - you must do so. or some unique key (like table_name_#{id})

Query
Create  (or update works as well).
Read
Update
Delete

You can get all the information about a record through 'Read'.
You can update the records facets (or it's score) with update / create
You can remove a record from the system with Delete. (that's a hard remove... no going back!)

Create/Update have the same API: (Example)
:id    => "45_recipe" (just .to_i in rails :))
:keys  => ["chicken", "soup", "nuts", {:ingredients=>[5]}, {instructions=>[10]}]
:score => {:popularity => 0.8, :quality => 0.5}


Query allows you to make a query on the database.
:search => {
  :and/or =>
    ['chicken', {:instructions=>[10,11,12]}]
},
:facets => { :chicken, :instructions, :ingredients, :publisher, :heart_healthy }

:score  => ... (TBD, for now it is always default), at times
  {
    :score_key => custom_weighting
  },
:page / :per_page

 < ======== Returns
:records => [key, key, key, key, key, key],
:facets  =>
{
  :instructions => { '45' => 33 items, '44' => 31 items },
  :chicken      => 8000
}
